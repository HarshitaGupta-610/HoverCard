# HoverCard
This project is a simple and visually appealing Hover Card UI Component created using only HTML and CSS.
When the user hovers over the card, additional information smoothly appears — making it a great small project to understand CSS transitions, card design, and hover effects.


The project demonstrates:
Clean card UI layout
Hover animation using CSS transform
Smooth overlay reveal using opacity transitions
Use of position: absolute for layered design
Image + information + hover-details structur

This contains my name and a hover effect.
